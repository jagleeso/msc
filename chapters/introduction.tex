TODO:
- industry cares about cold boot (SGX)
  - any examples of cold boot in the wild?
- 

This paper makes the following contributions:
\begin{itemize}
    \item We protect the user address space against DRAM attacks for applications deemed 
        sensitive without any modification to the applications themselves.
    \item We protect all AES sensitive state from being leaked into DRAM.
    \item We evaluate out-of-the-box onSoC secure memory in addition to simulated DRAM-speed 
        secure memory to inform hardware manufacturers interested in protecting modern 
        mobile applications.
    \item We provide a secure key storage and efficient execution environment that 
        transparently protects all algorithms in the Linux crypto API.
    \item We allow the execution of background applications and services while entirely encrypted.
    \item We measure the user interaction latency and energy overhead of protecting DRAM for 
        popular applications on a Nexus 4 Android phone.
\end{itemize}
